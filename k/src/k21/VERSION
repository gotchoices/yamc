** JOE 2.1

- rc file wasn't giving correct error messages for missing options
- the '-nobackups' options was mispelled: '- nobackups'
- undo gc would cause core dump if undo was never used
- update bypass in utype has a problem when wordwrapping and scrolling
- reformat paragraph expands ^KB^KK
- sequents don't have setitimer, even though they have SIGVTALRM
- old sgi's don't have _getpty: maybe svr4 pty allocation will work?
- forgot 'setcap' in terminfo.c

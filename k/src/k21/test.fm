PULLING MATERIALS: @f
Before a run is initiated, we must pull all materials already on
hand which can be used for that run.  You should have a stock area
for unallocated materials and a separate area for the materials
already pulled for a run.  It is critical to have this organized
so that materials are not over-ordered or under-ordered!
@p
Once the run is initiated, you will begin to receive the balance of the
necessary materials for the run.  Get these materials stocked (or
cut and then stocked) in an area reserved for that run (not in open
stock).
@p
Always make sure you check in all materials according to the CHECKIN
procedure (see documentation).
@p

DOCUMENTATION: @f
Before beginning work on a product (unless it is custom or prototype
work), you should be provided with a PO (to ATIFAB) and a copy of
the fabrication notes for each process listed on the PO.
If you do not have these items, notify Kyle.
@p
@p

MANUFACTURING STATUS SHEET: @f
You must keep a sheet (possibly in a file on the computer) showing
all pending fabrication orders with their part name, quantities, required 
time and completion dates.  Note that each part/process (not just product)
should be listed separately.
@p
First, write the ATI part name (process name) in a column called "process."
To determine completion time, 
look up the last PO of the same product and see how
many hours were required for the completion of the same items.
Write this number (or an adjusted estimate) in a column called "hours."  
Using this number and taking into account all other present fabrication, 
estimate a completion date for the part.  Write this date in a column
called "estimated completion date."  If this date is later than the
required completion date, notify David so appropriate adjustments can be made.
@p
Remember, it is more important to be accurate than to be fast!
@p
As time goes by, you may have to adjust the estimated completion date.  
If you do this, make sure David is aware of all changes.  
Customers who are waiting on product must be notified of any changes that
affect them.

CHECKLISTS:@f
The fabrication notes list some important QC criteria which you must
follow as you make each part.  However, the notes represent the minimum
required QC criteria.  You are encouraged to add to the notes to make
them more complete.
@p
As you (or and assistant) completes each step of the work, YOU must
check off the applicable items on the checklist.
@p
Regardless of whether a step is done by you or by an assistant, you are
responsible for quality control.
Any part that does not pass the criterion must be reworked until it is right.  
@p
When every QC criterion on a manufacturing note has been checked
by you, sign your name at the bottom of the sheet and write the date.
This is the completion date for the item described in the notes.
@p
When you sign your name you are certifying that you have performed 
the QC checks to the best of your ability.
If you disagree with the notes, bring up the needed changes with Kyle
or don't check off the item, but DO NOT CHECK OFF SOMETHING YOU HAVE
NOT DONE!
If you purposely check off an item you have not completed, there is
no forgiveness!
@p
You also have a purchase order (made out to ATIFAB) for each assembly
process you have completed.  However, there are no prices listed for the
processes listed.  On each line, write in the estimated time spent by
by you and your assistants (administrative included) to complete each item.
When you have completed all items on the PO, turn it in to Kyle.

EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT: @f
You will be supplied with employees as your work requires it.  
You may use employees to do work in the following circumstances:
@pn
~~~~1. The task will occupy the worker for more than 3 hours. @f
~~~~2. The worker can do the task(s) without interrupting you. @f
~~~~3. The worker can work at the required level of quality. @f
~~~~4. You have other work to keep you busy.
@p
In no case should your workers fill out your checklists or be relied upon
to pass quality control criteria.
It is @ul()your@nul job to certify the quality of each operation.  
You must check all work done by workers to make sure it adhears to 
the required quality criteria.
@p
You should prepare plenty of tasks well ahead of time so that you and
your workers do not spend time together setting up the work.
Lay out parts, tools, documentation and test
equipment in a clean work area ahead of time, so that when the worker is 
ready, he can start immediately on the next task.
@p
Don't wait until one task is done to think about  getting the next one ready.
In other words, when a worker has completed all tasks you have ready,
he is done and should go home.  
You can then prepare enough tasks to completely fill his next day.
@p
Ideally, you would do task preparation at the end of the day or early in
the morning.  Once you get your workers started on the day's tasks, you
should then concentrate exclusively on your own work--not on his.
@p
Meet with each of your employees once per pay period for a progress
meeting.  This is a good time to assess the happiness of each employee and
determine if there are things you or he can do to make things better.
This is an appropriate time to talk about the employees pay, the quality
of his work, and what materials or tools are needed in the shop.
As you meet with your supervisor (Kyle) you should summarize the feedback
you get in these meetings with your workers.
@p
In your periodic meetings with your employees, you should determine what
areas they need progress in.
Each employees bonus sheet and pay rate should be set to encourage as much
personal progress as possible.
@p
@p

SAFETY: @f
It is your job to assure the safest working conditions possible in the shop.
Each employee must show up to work in clothing safe for the work he is
doing such as sleeved shirts where applicable, steel toed shoes, long pants.
You must provide other safety equipment for each employee such as safety
glasses, masks, gloves etc.
@p
@p

SUPPLIES: @f
You have a supply budget which you can use to purchase miscellaneous
items needed to do your work.
The general rule is as follows:
@p
Items which are (or become) part of the product sold should come out of
the manufacturing budget.  
Therefore, they should be purchased by way of of the PURCHASING ROUND
WORKSHEET.  (This also applies to parts such as conduit and anchors which
might not get used until an installation is performed.)
@p
Large tools (over about $50) should be requested from Kyle and then
purchased by him out of the capital equipment budget, not your supply budget.
Small tools or other items which are not clearly associated with a
particular product should be paid for out of your supply budget.
Your supply budget may also be used for misc. gas, paper, office
supplies or other small things which are needed to complete your job.
@p
In general, if you find that you are needing to purchase something
that doesn't seem to fit within a budget category which you are empowered
to authorize, you are probably doing something which is out of your area.
Ask Kyle about it.
@p
See the BUDGETS document for more information about budgets.
